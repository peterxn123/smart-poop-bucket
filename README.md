# smart-poop-bucket
Smart 3D printer poop bucket suitable for the Bambu A1. Track your poop with the web interface.

Why did I create this? Well, simply put, I hate the waste produced by multicolour prints. I like to minimise my waste when printing, and I also when I sell my multicolour prints I need to calculate the price by including the weight of the poop and the printed objects. So, I thought it would be really handy, rather than me having to empty my poop bin and weigh it myself every time, instead have a smart poop bin where I can keep track of the poop weight of each print, without having to go through the hassle of weighing it myself.
